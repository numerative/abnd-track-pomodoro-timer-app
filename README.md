## Project Title
**Pomodoro - get more done, faster.**

## Project Description
- [Orginal post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/my-collaborative-project-idea/618377)
- [Current Slack thread](https://googleindiascholars.slack.com/archives/GD96L4VA4/p1539274648000100)

The Pomodoro technique  is a simple idea of tricking oneself into working/studying for short 25-minute intervals for a return of short 5/5/5/15-minute break cycles. This results in focused work sessions and a lowered tendency to giving-in to distractions.

Central to this technique is a loudly ticking countdown timer and turns out that a physical timer isn't required if one has a smartphone. Tens of thousands (probably more) of people use some pomodoro app and there are many Pomodoro apps in the market, but nothing beats a simple app.

This project aims to build a complete and functional pomodoro timer app before phase 2 ends on 30/11/2018.
